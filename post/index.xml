I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD candidate in the political science department at the George Washington University.
My dissertation research examines the effects of strategic competition, organizational behavior, and civilian technological innovation on the development of nuclear command and control systems in the United States, Russia, France, and China.
During summer 2017 I will be a predoctoral researcher at the Center for Global Security Research at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where I will be working on several projects related to European security and Russian nuclear strategy and policy.</description>
